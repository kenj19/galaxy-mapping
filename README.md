# galaxy-mapping

Code related to the mapping of galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Much of the code relies on U-Net recovered ionization maps post foreground wedge-removal as described in [Gagnon-Hartman et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.4716G/abstract) and generated using the [wedge-simulator](https://github.com/j-c-carr/wedge-simulator) and [wedge-recovery](https://github.com/j-c-carr/wedge-recovery) modules.
